      The secret to learning how humans are built [lies] deep in the heart of
      these cells. Specifically, the Human Cell Atlas project aims to find out
      which genes are turned on at what times and in which locations.
      Researchers have now published details of how this happens in skin. This
      raises the possibility of eventually slowing down the signs of ageing.
